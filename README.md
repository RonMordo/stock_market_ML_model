# stock_market_ML_model
This project is my first machine learning model to predict stock prices. It uses historical data, cleans and processes it, and applies basic algorithms like Linear Regression to forecast future prices. The model's accuracy is evaluated with metrics such as MAE and RMSE, and results are visualized to compare predictions with actual prices.
