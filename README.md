Stock Market Prediction Model
This project is my first foray into machine learning, focusing on developing a basic model to predict stock market trends. The model leverages historical stock price data and applies machine learning algorithms to forecast future stock prices. Key features include:

Data Collection: Historical stock price data is gathered from reliable financial databases.
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and prepared, including handling missing values and normalizing the data.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features such as moving averages, trading volume, and other financial indicators are created.
Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees, are trained and evaluated.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.
Visualization: The results are visualized using graphs to compare the predicted prices with actual stock prices.
This project serves as an introduction to the basics of machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, providing a foundation for more advanced projects in the future.
